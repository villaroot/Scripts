filterIPs.py is used for checking if an IP is In Scope and not in the Excluded IP List.
It can take CIDR IPs and expands them to the full IP list. Meaning it's possible to provide a value such as
192.0.0.0/24 and the script will expand it to all IPs in the /24 subnet.

There are two options to provide the In Scope and Excluded IPs.
1. provide with parameters
    -x Excluded IP file
    -i In Scope IP file
    Usage: filterIPs.py -x <ExcludedIPsFile> -i <inScopeIPsFile>

2. Manually input the location into the script's code. This is best if you don't want to keep passing the parameters. 
  Manually put the location in the variables: manualInScopeLocation and manualExcludeLocation
  Make sure to put quotes around the location and put double slashes in the path.
  For example instead of: manualInScopeLocation = "c:\location.txt"
  do: manualInScopeLocation = "c:\\location.txt"
