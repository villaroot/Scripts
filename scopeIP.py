scopeIP.py is used for checking if an IP is In Scope and not in the Excluded IP List.
It can take CIDR IPs and expands them to the full IP list. Meaning it's possible to provide a value such as 192.0.0.0/24 and the script will expand it to all IPs in the /24 subnet.

    scopeIP.py
      -x Excluded IPs file
      -i In Scope IPs file
      -s single IP to check
      -f file of IPs to check

      Usage:
        python3 scopeIP.py [-x FILE] [-i FILE] [-s STRING] [-f FILE]

      Example:
        python3 scopeIP.py -x 'c:\excludedIP.txt' -i 'c:\inScopeIPs.txt' -s 10.10.10.10

        python3 scopeIP.py -x 'c:\excludedIP.txt' -i 'c:\inScopeIPs.txt' -f 'c:\\targets.txt'
